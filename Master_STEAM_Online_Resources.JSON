It's different from traditional search engines because it generates outputs by doing computations from its own internal knowledge base, rather than searching the web or a database of formatted pages.\nWolfram Alpha is particularly useful for mathematical calculations, data analysis, and generating plots and charts. It can solve equations, perform integrals, analyze statistical data, and much more. Besides mathematics, Wolfram Alpha covers a wide range of subjects including science, engineering, astronomy, economics, and geography. It can also handle queries about dates and times, weather, places, data comparison, and even linguistics.",
